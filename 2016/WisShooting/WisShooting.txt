It all began around 7 a.m. Sunday, when police in West Allis received a report of a man forcing his way into a pair of apartments.

Responding officers found 42-year-old Gabriel Sanchez fatally shot, authorities said. The 20-year old suspect also had made threats to a member of Epikos Church, which canceled Sunday evening services in Milwaukee.

The suspect and his two brothers later drove in a Chevrolet Blazer to Wisconsin Dells.

They were traveling south on Interstate 90/94 toward Madison on Sunday afternoon when a family of four -- Tracy Czaczkowski, her 43-year-old husband and their children -- passed them on their way back to Illinois after a weekend in the resort city.

The 20-year-old man was driving the Blazer and opened fire on the family's BMW sedan, Dane County sheriff's spokeswoman Elise Schaffer said. He shot the car twice, hitting Czaczkowski in the neck, authorities said. Another round struck a Nissan sedan, but the Florida woman driving that car wasn't hurt.

Other motorists called 911. Officers from multiple agencies chased the Blazer into Dane County, where deputies stopped the SUV with a spike strip.
